# Multimodal Brain Integration Networks (mBIN)
Multimodal Brain Integration Networks (mBIN) is toolbox for high dimensional analysis of brain networks across multiple imaging modalities. Our goal is to enable high level visualization and interpretation of  structual and functional brain data across micro to macro scales. 

This repository includes analysis software used in the following publications:
